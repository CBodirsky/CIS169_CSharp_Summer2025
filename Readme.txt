Wrapping up the summer semester with C# (CIS 169 at DMACC) and thought I'd cleanly upload everything. 
Originally built C# with .NET 8.0, Visual Studio 2022 in almost all cases, but all do work there.
Modules are broken up by the module number and topics. Inside is each project's submission I made for class. I believe I fixed all the unit tests and there SHOULDN'T be any issues running any of them as is, but it wouldn't surprise me if one or two slip by. And honestly I'm not going to bother going back and checking every one of them to fix it. These aren't exactly commercial products or anything to double check. Also the "ToggleLine" image is where to go in Visual Studio/Code to change to Ctrl / for commenting out instead of the...what is it by default now? Ctrl + K then Ctrl + /?
In particular I'm happy with the three unit tests being demonstrated (module 3, 5, and 9), which I'm told unit tests are something kind of special. I had fun with the module 4, starting to build some loops. Module 8 through 10 were of most interest for me, however and where I felt the most "shaky." So I guess that's where I had the best learning in the class. 

Also, future me, here's a couple of things I have cooking. How did we do?
That notepad app (you know the one)
Asset Rush Online (Roblox)
Asset Rush Mobile (Android)
Arcane Intake (Android)
That unnamed gem slotting game (Android)
Ostranauts 3D in Unity protoype (Unity)
And...we don't have a name for the project, but right now I'm referring to it with the girl's name, Emiora. (C#, likely Unity)
