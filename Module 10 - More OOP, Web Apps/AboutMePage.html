	<h2><center>Things I Enjoy</center></h2>
	<p>I have a wide range of interests. From video games and anime to home improvement projects and working on cars. I even dabble in programming sometimes. Games I enjoy include simulations, strategy, and sim racing primarily. The picture above is from one of several virtual racing leagues I've participated in with friends. We race each other clean, but hard! Pictured here I am driving the 2017 Mercedes Benz A45, A-Class edition (with a Domino's Pizza design).</p>
	<p>Past that I tend to hop around in interests regularly, such as recently becoming passionate about writing a proof for the Collatz Conjecture.</p>
